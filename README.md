# StandByBaby

Abstract
---------------
Our team is trying to create a function that helps parenting through stand by me and NUGU speakers. Double-income families are under stress over childcare. Among them, the hardest thing to feel is a child who cries day and night. Children have an irregular sleep cycle because their nervous system is less developed. Since day and night cannot be distinguished immediately after birth, parents should create an appropriate sleep environment at a set time. It is very important to sleep well during newborn or early childhood. This is because growth hormones are actively secreted, which determines the child's growth. Through functions that help raise children, we will help children sleep comfortably and give parents and children great happiness and satisfaction.

Motivation
--------------
 - Our team focused on making appliances that help newlyweds raise their children. Many newlyweds have lovely babies and gain great happiness. However, it is also true that couples are under a lot of parenting stress to take care of their lovely children. There are several types of parenting stress, such as a war of nerves with a child, a child's bad eating habits, and a solitary parenting.
Our team thought about what was the biggest parenting stress for newlyweds who take care of their babies. We thought that the most difficult thing about taking care of the baby was not being able to sleep well because of the baby. Babies in newborns and infants have irregular sleep cycles because their nervous systems are less developed.

 - During this period, the baby does not sleep at night, or can't sleep deeply and is unable to sleep deeply. Whenever that happens, the baby cries or shouts, and every time that happens, the parents also wake up and try to put the baby to sleep. We think this situation is a natural parent's love for the baby and is an essential parenting behavior. But parents are human, too. If these days continue every day, mental and physical stress builds up, which I think will be bad for the baby because parents cannot take care of the baby in full health.

 - So we thought it would be nice to have an application that helps the baby sleep and care. First of all, We thought about <What helps a baby sleep?>. Our team searched for various data, and was able to found one research. According to a published study, babies affected by white noise fell asleep faster. At that time, the research team conducted a survey of 40 newborns and confirmed that 80% of the babies in the subjects fell asleep in five minutes in a white noise environment. It is said that the baby can have a significant effect because it is already exposed to sounds similar to white noise from the mother's womb.
 
 - So the application we're designing plays white noise or music that helps the baby sleep when it recognizes the baby's crying at a certain time(ex 12a.m to 5a.m). In addition, there are functions that can be useful in the usual childcare environment. For example, when a baby cries or shouts in a situation where parents receive a phone call or go out urgently, the application can detect the baby's voice and add favorite music and videos to reduce the baby's anxiety.
This application that we're designing will help create a healthy sleep environment for baby. We think parents will be a reliable helper in taking care of the baby.

Problem Statement
--------------------
- In 2021, 52% of newlyweds have dual-income families. This is a 2.4 percent increase from last year and is expected to increase more and more.
- Childcare is the most troublesome problem if you work together. It is also the biggest reason for giving up giving birth.
- Not only are there couples who cannot use parental leave, but they cannot use it for a long time. There is also a limit to taking care of children or grandparents being able to take care of children.
- In addition, the most difficult situation for parents is when their child does not sleep or wakes up at dawn.
- Therefore, it is necessary to create a bed environment for children to sleep well so that parents and children can have regular sleep patterns.
